# GifTastic
Project for GIPHY API to make a dynamic web page 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Project built by JQuery, JavaScript, API, Ajax and SessionStorage.

This project will help students or anyone new or familiar with the above listed programs. 

When the page loads there will be 10 buttons, each with distinct animal names. The user can add any animal in the input box. When the user hits the submit button a new button will be created with the name the user inputed. 

When the button are clicked 10 static images of the animal will be dispalyed. If the static images are clicked an animated Gif wimage will be displayed, and vice versa. 

The animal names the user inputed will be saved in session storage meaning that even if the page reloads there would be a button for the inputed animals. However, if the tab where the page is created is closed the buttons will be deleted.

It is useful to understand or use as a reference for the concept of 
            - DOM manipulation 
            - Binding an events to multiple classes,elements, id and etc...
            - Scope 
            - Objects
            - Arrays
            - API
            - Json
            - Ajax
            - Session Storage
            
            
I recommend you to look at the HTML before jumping into either script or CSS

I have tried to give a comment on all the jquery functions and variables which I hope will help you understand the code easily.
